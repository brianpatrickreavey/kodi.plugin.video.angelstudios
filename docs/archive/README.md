# Archived Documentation

This directory contains research and investigation documents from feature development. These are **not active** implementation guides but rather exploration notes and analysis that may be useful for reference.

## Contents

- **IMAGE_PREFETCH_RESEARCH.md** — Research on image prefetching strategies
- **IMAGE_PREFETCH_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md** — Verification guide for image prefetch implementation
- **INFOTAGS_OPTIMIZATION_RESEARCH.md** — Research on infotag optimization approaches
- **TIMING_ANALYSIS.md** — Performance analysis and timing measurements
- **TIMING_INSTRUMENTATION.md** — Instrumentation patterns for performance monitoring

## Why Archived?

After implementation, these documents serve as historical context but are not the authoritative source of truth. For current implementation details, refer to:

- **Active Docs:** [../README.md](../README.md)
- **Architecture:** [../data_structure.md](../data_structure.md)
- **Metadata Mapping:** [../metadata-mapping.md](../metadata-mapping.md)
- **Caching Patterns:** [../DEFERRED_CACHE_WRITES.md](../DEFERRED_CACHE_WRITES.md)
- **Features:** [../features/](../features/)

Use this archive to understand decisions and trade-offs, but implement based on active docs and code comments.
